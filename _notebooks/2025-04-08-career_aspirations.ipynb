    "- First, the career quiz was meant to be a Study Resource Table which would appear after a user plays a trivia game. However, in order to make this its own, distinct feature, I changed this to be its own interactive quiz to help users determine their career path based on their love for biotechnology\n",
    "    - There is a set of 5 questions that ask about the user's interest in biotechnology \n",
    "    - The score they get will be matched to the scores of other people from a kaggle dataset to determine their career path\n",
    "    - The user will be able to compare their results to that of the dataset and get an idea of what they could achieve in the future based on past data"
