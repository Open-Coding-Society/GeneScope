# üß¨ Genetic Mutation Risk Predictor Game

Welcome to the **Mutation Predictor Quiz**!  
Answer the questions below to calculate your *personalized chance* of having a genetic mutation.  
Each answer influences the risk score ‚Äî some increase your chances, some lower them.  
When you're done, hit "Run Prediction" to see your results!

---

## üë§ 1. What's your name?

`[___________]` *(type here)*

---

## üéÇ 2. How old are you?

- [ ] Under 18  
- [ ] 18‚Äì34  
- [ ] 35‚Äì60  
- [ ] 61+

---

## üß¨ 3. Do you have a **family history** of genetic mutations?

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  
- [ ] Not Sure  

> üß† *Why it matters:* Inherited mutations significantly increase your risk.

---

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è 4. Have you experienced **high exposure to radiation** (e.g. work, environment, therapy)?

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  

> üí° *Note:* Radiation can increase mutation rates in cells over time.

---

## üèÉ 5. How would you describe your **lifestyle**?

- [ ] Sedentary  
- [ ] Moderately Active  
- [ ] Very Active  

> üçî *Fact:* Sedentary lifestyle may correlate with increased cell stress and mutation susceptibility.

---

## üåç 6. What is your **region of ancestry**?

- [ ] Europe  
- [ ] Asia  
- [ ] Africa  
- [ ] Middle East  
- [ ] Americas  

> üß¨ *Note:* Certain gene variants are more common in specific populations.

---

## üß© 7. Have you ever been diagnosed with a **rare disorder**?

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No  
- [ ] Prefer not to say  

> üß† *Why it matters:* Some rare disorders are linked to underlying mutations.

## üöÄ Click below to reveal your mutation risk score:

### ‚èπÔ∏è Run Mutation Prediction

```python
# Risk weights logic (Python backend - not functional in markdown)
risk_score = 0

if age == 'Under 18':
    risk_score += 10
elif age == '18‚Äì34':
    risk_score += 5
elif age == '35‚Äì60':
    risk_score += 2

if family_history == 'Yes':
    risk_score += 25

if radiation_exposure == 'Yes':
    risk_score += 15

if lifestyle == 'Sedentary':
    risk_score += 10
elif lifestyle == 'Moderately Active':
    risk_score += 5

region_risk = {
    'Europe': 5, 'Asia': 8, 'Africa': 6, 'Middle East': 12, 'Americas': 7
}
risk_score += region_risk[region]

if rare_disorder == 'Yes':
    risk_score += 20

mutation_chance = min(risk_score, 100)
no_mutation = 100 - mutation_chance

print(f"üß¨ Chance of Mutation: {mutation_chance:.2f}%")
print(f"‚úÖ Chance of No Mutation: {no_mutation:.2f}%")
